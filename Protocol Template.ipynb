    "# Protocol template\n",
    "We recommend the following structure for describing the protocol and its example workflow. Below you can find an overview of required features of the protocol and its description and rules for best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the link to the github repository of the protocol \n",
    "TODO add version!\n",
    "https://github.com/ProtProtocols/biocontainer-jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to docker image:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Provide a short description of the software protocol including broader context, functionality, use case and purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintainer\n",
    "Provide details about the protocol maintainer (e.g. email address and/or github username)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links\n",
    "Specify links documentation and tutorials of used software, source code, publications and use cases. Alternatively, provide links to the software descriptions in https://bio.tools where this information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram\n",
    "Provide a simple diagram of functionality of the workflow/software. We recommend using controlled vocabularies for input/output data types and file formats as well as provided operation of the tool(s). You can use http://edamontology.org terms for the description.\n",

    "Required memory: \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommmended number of threads: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example \n",
    "Presentation of well-documented instructions and commands to run the example use case. Depending on the use case and the software, provide link(s) to open the web service incorportated in the Docker image (e.g. 0.0.0.0:8080), bash commands to run programs from the command line and additional code for e.g. checking and visualizing the (intermediate) results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of providing the instructions in this notebook, one can also provide a link to a notebook containing the example use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More general use case (optional)\n",
    "Provide link to notebook with a generalized use case that easily can be adapted to e.g. process different input data and concurrent parametrization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With possibility to use specific version of the protocol/settings if needed using sort of a “client” to the protocol -> will be there when providing dockers as biocontainers\n",
    "* Control for unsuitable data and error messages, well-defined access to log-files from the protocol runs\n",
    "* Provide log-files in specific folders and also give feedback when running the commands in the example or other cases\n",
    "* Validation of intermediate results QC (validation but also as documentation, do the results make sense?)\n",

    "### Must-haves\n",
    "* Links to additional material\n",
    "* Fully running example\n",
    "* Strict reproducible instructions for example case\n",
    "* Describe parametrization to deal with other data sets + not that reproducible instructions for additional use cases\n",
    "* Strictly define limitations, therein minimal system requirements (RAM, disk space, CPU power to run protocol (docker) OK time)\n",
    "* Shared/generic interface to the different protocols: proteomics-academy.org webpage? Showing overview of protocols +  their workflow visualizations would be nice.\n",
    "* Protocol/settings versioning (part of docker image versions) \n",
    "* With possibility to use specific version of the protocol/settings if needed using sort of a “client” to the protocol -> will be there when providing dockers as biocontainers\n",
    "* Control for unsuitable data and error messages, well-defined access to log-files from the protocol runs\n",
    "* Provide log-files in specific folders and also give feedback when running the commands in the example or other cases\n",
    "* Validation of intermediate results QC (validation but also as documentation, do the results make sense?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best practice\n",
    "* Providing links of each/most software tools to bio.tools\n",
    "* Workflow diagram/scheme, maybe with controlled vocabulary (e.g. dot file instructions in * Jupyter notebook, software requirement analysis document RAD-like format)\n",
    "* Well-defined descriptions of how and where to change parameters and input files of the protocol pipeline (e.g fasta file)\n",
    "* Via web interface change settings file\n",
    "* Change in scripts\n",
    "* Should work on all platforms (probably obsolete as most of them run on Docker)\n",
    "* Presentation of the intermediate results (graphs, overview of the tables) and possibility to discontinue program execution\n",
    "* Using it in batch mode on example case\n",
    "* Use case diagram\n",
    "* Optimally restricted user input for parameter settings to be more robust on the long run\n",
    "* Encourage verbosity\n",
    "* I/O formats, it can be zipped, hdf or other. Allow for customization. ( ultimately user controls where the organisation of the data) \n",
    "* On the long run: input file handler?\n",
    "* Optional features (O)\n",
    "* Video tutorials\n",
    "* Easily distributed computation\n"
