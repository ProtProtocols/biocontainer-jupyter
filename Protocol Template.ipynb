    "# Protocol template\n",
    "We recommend the following structure for describing the protocol and its example workflow. Below you can find an overview of required features of the protocol and its description and rules for best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the link to the github repository of the protocol \n",
    "TODO add version!\n",
    "https://github.com/ProtProtocols/biocontainer-jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to docker image:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Provide a short description of the software protocol including broader context, functionality, use case and purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintainer\n",
    "Provide details about the protocol maintainer (e.g. email address and/or github username)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "Specify links for documentation and tutorials of used software, source code, publications and use cases. Detail versions of each used software. Alternatively, provide links to the software descriptions in https://bio.tools where this information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram\n",
    "Provide a simple diagram of functionality of the workflow/software. We recommend using controlled vocabularies for input/output data types and file formats as well as provided operation of the tool(s). You can use http://edamontology.org terms for the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "__TODO: example__\n",
    "\n",
    "## System requirements\n",
    "Fill in the following items:\n",
    "Required hard disk space for docker image, input and output files: \n",
    "\n",
    "Required memory: \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommmended number of threads: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example \n",
    "Presentation of well-documented instructions and commands to run the example use case. Depending on the use case and the software, provide link(s) to open the web service incorportated in the Docker image (e.g. 0.0.0.0:8080), bash commands to run programs from the command line and additional code for e.g. checking and visualizing the (intermediate) results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of providing the instructions in this notebook, one can also provide a link to a notebook containing the example use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More general use case (optional)\n",
    "Provide link to notebook with a generalized use case that easily can be adapted to e.g. process different input data and concurrent parametrization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checklist for required features and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-haves\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General\n",
    "* Links to additional material\n",
    "* Fully running example\n",
    "* Strictly defined limitations, therein minimal system requirements (RAM, disk space, CPU power to run protocol on docker image)\n",
    "* Protocol versioning (part of docker image versions) \n",
    "* Well-defined access to log-files from the protocol runs via _LOG_ folder\n",
    "* All input files including the ones for the example are in folder _IN_\n",
    "* All output files and intermediate results are available in folder _OUT_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strict reproducible instructions for example case\n",
    "* Describe parametrization to extend use case to other input data or different analyses\n",
    "* Control for incorrect intermediate results and error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best practice\n",
    "#### General\n",
    "* Provide links of used software tools in bio.tools\n",
    "* Workflow diagram/scheme using controlled vocabulary (e.g. dot file instructions in Jupyter notebook named by EDAM ontology terms)\n",
    "* Separate Jupyter notebooks for example use case and generalized workflow that allows adjustment to different input data formats and different use cases\n",
    "* Allow customization of I/O formats (e.g. zipped files).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* Well-defined descriptions of how and where to change parameters and input files of the protocol pipeline (e.g fasta file)\n",
    "* Interactive setting of parameters in notebook (e.g. selection in list or ruler for numerical input with defined limits)\n",
    "* Visual evaluation of the intermediate results (figures, overview of the tables) and possibility to discontinue program execution\n",
    "* One-click analysis of entire example use case\n",
    "* Verbosity (e.g. automatic output of log-files into notebook cells\n"
